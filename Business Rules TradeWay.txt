TradeWay Business Rules
========================

1. Account Roles and Verification
   - Each account must belong to exactly one role: buyer, vendor, driver, or admin. Role changes require admin approval.
   - Vendors and drivers must complete KYC verification before listing products, bidding, or accepting logistics jobs.
   - A suspended or unverified account cannot create listings, place bids, or receive payouts until reinstated.

2. Product Listings
   - Every product listing must include a clear title, detailed description, category, price, quantity, and location before it can be published.
   - Listings must contain at least one image that passes automated grading; rejected images require replacement before relisting.
   - Vendors must maintain accurate inventory counts; a product automatically disables when quantity reaches zero.
   - Duplicate listings (same product, identical specs, same vendor) are rejected to keep the catalog clean.

3. Bidding and Orders
   - Buyers can submit bids only on active, unsold products; bids lock for 24 hours or until the vendor responds.
   - Vendors must accept, counter, or reject bids within 48 hours; stale bids auto-expire to protect inventory availability.
   - Once a bid is accepted, an order record is created and the associated product quantity is reserved.
   - Orders cannot be marked as fulfilled until both payment confirmation and shipment initiation are recorded.

4. Pricing and Payments
   - All prices must be in the platform’s base currency (PKR) and include applicable taxes; currency conversion is handled at checkout.
   - Vendors cannot raise the price of an active listing by more than 20% within a 7-day period to prevent price gouging.
   - Refunds above PKR 100,000 require admin approval and must reference a valid dispute or return case.

5. Disputes and Compliance
   - Dispute tickets must be opened within 7 days of delivery; evidence (photos, documents) is mandatory for escalation.
   - Three unresolved disputes against the same vendor within 30 days automatically pauses their storefront pending review.
   - Any detected fraudulent activity (fake bids, counterfeit goods, payment abuse) triggers immediate suspension and AML review.

6. Logistics and Drivers
   - Drivers must keep vehicle and license documents current; expired documents trigger automatic job lockout.
   - A driver cannot accept more than two concurrent shipments unless manually approved by logistics staff.

7. Notifications and Auditing
   - Critical actions (listing published, bid accepted, order cancelled, payout released) must generate both in-app and email notifications.
   - All admin overrides (price edits, user suspensions, dispute resolutions) must include a reason note for auditing.

8. Data Retention
   - Transaction and communication records are retained for a minimum of five years for compliance and analytics.
   - Users can request data export, but deletion requests are honored only when all financial and legal obligations are closed.
